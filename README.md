The codes implemented various RL algorithms on a grid world problem.

It is divided into two parts: part 1 and part 2.

Part 1 implementation contains model-based algorithms for policy evaluation and obtaining optimal policy.

Part 2 implementation contains model-free algorithms that involves Monte Carlo on-policy control and off-policy control.

Each part has a python file and a jupyter notebook file.

run either the .py or .pynb for each part to get the results.
